Remote RStudio session: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aluro2/AMRO_pattern_egg_rejection_JEB/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Binder supports using R and RStudio, with libraries pinned to a specific versions.

Code for analyses are found in the Scripts directory and should be run by the numeric order of their names. *brms* models may not run as expected due to compilation issues on binder, but all model outputs can be found in the Results directory.
